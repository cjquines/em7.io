## notes to contributors

- start commit messages with verbs (like all these lists)
- use 2 spaces for tabs
- write state/props documentation for all components
- sort things alphabetically when it makes sense
- push only if nothing is broken (preferred, but not necessary)

## todo

- fix bugs:
    - the interaction between time signature, snap interval, tempo, and snapping, is wrong
    - what happens when you try to snap after editting? at least show a message saying this is bad
